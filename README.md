# Detection-of-extreme-weather-events
This project aims to classify weather events such as i) standard ii) Tropical cyclone and iii) Atmospheric river using set of climate variables for different time, lattitude and longitude. Dataset used was subset of ClimatNet was part of Kaggle competition under course IFT6390. Baseline model was considered as Dummy classifier. Here I used Logistic regression for multiclass classification from scratch. Logistic regression is implemented using Stochastic gradient descent method to calculate weights. To improve performance on Kaggle leaderboard, more features were added and models such as Random forest, gradient boosting and Lightgbm was explored using 5 fold cross validation. Lightgbm being better performing model than other models explored gave 89% of accuracy on train set was achieved using Lightgbm and achieved 0.78415 on private leaderboard: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ift3395-6390-weatherevents/leaderboard
